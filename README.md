# A Simple Windows Toolbox made using Batch file

---

### How to use:
- Run the batch file as **Administrator**, otherwise some of the core functions won't work properly
- Make sure that you have the batch file on your **DESKTOP** (it just makes it easier for you to find it for the future use, also fixes many issues locating the file itself)
